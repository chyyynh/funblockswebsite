Anime – what started as a niche genre of manga and animation has become a multi-billion dollar industry in its own right, with chart-topping games like Pokémon Go and Genshin Impact grossing billions and movies like Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba becoming one of the highest grossing films of the year. Anime is driving pop culture today; just look at the fashion collaborations like Loewe x Studio Ghibli or famous lyrics from artists like Chance the Rapper and The Weeknd. We estimate the total market size of anime to be north of $50B, once accounting for anime, comics, and games (data.ai, Precedence Research).

動漫 – 最初是漫畫和動畫的小眾類型，本身已經成為一個價值數十億美元的產業，Pokémon Go 和 Genshin Impact 等排行榜榜首遊戲票房達數十億美元，而《鬼滅之刃：鬼滅之刃》等電影成為年度票房最高的電影之一。動漫正在推動當今的流行文化;看看 Loewe x Studio Ghibli 等時尚合作系列，或者 Chance the Rapper 和 The Weeknd 等藝術家的著名歌詞就知道了。我們估計動漫的總市場規模超過 $50B，曾經包括動漫、漫畫和遊戲（data.ai，Precedence Research）。

Yet, we believe that anime is just getting started – today, new technologies and business models are accelerating a once niche industry to even greater heights. Anime is where the future of creation and play is happening, whether with innovative games on our phones, user-created fanfictions and games, roleplaying as the characters themselves, or interactions with AI-versions of these fictional beings. We believe that anime will become one of the dominant formats through which we consume and engage with content.

然而，我們相信動漫才剛剛開始——今天，新技術和商業模式正在將曾經的小眾行業加速到更高的高度。動漫是創造和遊戲的未來發生的地方，無論是我們手機上的創新遊戲、用戶創建的同人小說和遊戲、角色扮演本身，還是與這些虛構生物的 AI 版本互動。我們相信動漫將成為我們消費和參與內容的主要形式之一。

The usual lifecycle of an anime fan looks something like this: they are introduced to the format with great IP – the Attack on Titan anime or the One Piece live action show or one of the miHoYo games. They then deepen their fandom through new forms of social and creative engagement (UGC, VTubing, community formation, cosplay, etc.). What we’re most excited about is how anime engagement has evolved from passive to interactive over the last few years. This has happened along a few different axes:

動漫迷的通常生命週期是這樣的：他們被介紹給具有出色 IP 的格式——進擊的巨人動漫或海賊王真人秀或 miHoYo 遊戲之一。然後，他們通過新形式的社交和創意參與（UGC、VTubing、社區形成、角色扮演等）來加深他們的粉絲群。我們最興奮的是動漫參與在過去幾年中如何從被動演變為互動。這發生在幾個不同的軸上：

Anime is a genre of animation that originated from Japan and is known for its distinctive art style: bright colorful graphics, strong outlines, large, exaggerated eyes and features, and brightly colored hair. It originated in the early 1900s with visual strips, but really started becoming more popular in the 60s and 70s with shows like Astro Boy, Lupin III, Akira, Mobile Suit Gundam, and of course, Hayao Miyazaki’s works at Studio Ghibli. Anime entered the mainstream in the 2000s with popular shounen anime like Naruto, One Piece, and now Attack on Titan. You might see football players referencing the Attack on Titan salute as a celebration, or pop culture memes all around the internet.

動漫是一種起源於日本的動畫類型，以其獨特的藝術風格而聞名：明亮多彩的圖形、強烈的輪廓、誇張的大眼睛和特徵以及色彩鮮豔的頭髮。它起源於 1900 年代初期的視覺條帶，但在 60 年代和 70 年代真正開始變得更加流行，例如鐵臂阿童木、魯邦三世、阿基拉、機動戰士高達，當然還有宮崎駿在吉卜力工作室的作品。動漫在 2000 年代隨著火影忍者、海賊王和現在的進擊的巨人等流行的少年動漫進入主流。您可能會看到足球運動員將進擊的巨人敬禮作為慶祝活動，或者互聯網上到處都是流行文化模因。

Nowadays anime is more popular than ever: Crunchyroll estimated that viewership doubled between 2020-2022 alone to over 300M fans worldwide. Netflix reported in 2022 that over half of its subscribers worldwide watched some anime content on its platform. The top 4 Discord servers worldwide are all anime-related. Anime is also a medium that caters to many different audience types, from mature seinen anime like Monster to classic action shounen like Demon Slayer or Naruto, from female-oriented shoujo like Ouran High School Club to contemplative slice of life stories like Mushi-shi. Because of this broad appeal, there’s a huge community of diverse fans that have engaged with the medium over many years and developed strong affinity toward IP and characters. This affinity has led to one of the most popular use cases of AI recently –  AI waifus and husbandos.

如今，動漫比以往任何時候都更受歡迎：Crunchyroll 估計，僅在 2020 年至 2022 年期間，收視率就翻了一番，全球粉絲超過 300M。Netflix 在 2022 年報告稱，其全球超過一半的訂閱者在其平台上觀看了一些動漫內容。全球排名前 4 的 Discord 伺服器都與動漫相關。動漫也是一種迎合許多不同觀眾類型的媒介，從像 Monster 這樣的成熟少年動漫到像鬼滅之刃或火影忍者這樣的經典動作少年，從像 Ouran High School Club 這樣面向女性的少女到像 Mushi-shi 這樣沉思的生活故事片段。由於這種廣泛的吸引力，有一個龐大的多元化粉絲社區，他們多年來一直與這種媒體互動，並對 IP 和角色產生了強烈的親和力。這種親和力導致了最近最流行的 AI 用例之一——AI waifus 和 husbandos。

First, to explain popular slang – what is a waifu or husbando? Waifus / husbandos are fictionalized girls and guys who viewers feel some level of emotional or romantic attachment to. This isn’t as rare of an occurrence as one might think; Polygon reported that 44% of surveyed anime viewers reported developing a crush on an anime character. “The other 56% are lying,” the report jokes. After all, anime fans tend to express their fandom deeply through merch, fanart, conventions, cosplay, and other means (66% make some form of fan art according to fandom). So it’s not surprising that they would also develop a deep attachment to the characters. Anime Expo in LA for instance, routinely attracts hundreds of thousands of fans each year, the a16z team included.

首先，解釋一行的俚語——什麼是 waifu 或 husbando？Waifus / husbandos 是虛構的女孩和男孩，觀眾對他們有某種程度的情感或浪漫依戀。這並不像人們想像的那麼罕見;Polygon 報告稱，44% 的受訪動漫觀眾表示對動漫角色產生了好感。“其他 56% 的人在撒謊，”報告開玩笑說。畢竟，動漫迷傾向於通過商品、同人作品、慣例、角色扮演和其他方式來深刻表達他們的粉絲群（66% 的人根據粉絲群製作某種形式的粉絲藝術）。因此，他們也會對角色產生深深的依戀也就不足為奇了。例如，洛杉磯的動漫博覽會每年都會吸引數十萬粉絲，包括 a16z 團隊。

Waifu / husbando culture derives from visual novels, and AI companions are the logical extension of these animated storybook games. Originally, visual novels were serialized books with anime-styled pictures in between. But now the term colloquially refers to the digital version in which the player has agency, with branching storylines where you roleplay as the main character, advancing through the plot and choosing to romance other male/female characters. This is a relatively niche market (~$150M according to some sources), but one that has an outsized impact on the industry. For example, Fate/Grand Order, one of the most successful gacha games with $5B+ cumulative revenue, is descended from a visual novel called Fate/Stay Night.

Waifu / husbando 文化源於視覺小說，AI 伴侶是這些動畫故事書遊戲的邏輯延伸。最初，視覺小說是連載書籍，中間有動漫風格的圖片。但現在這個詞通俗地指的是玩家擁有代理權的數位版本，具有分支故事情節，您可以在其中扮演主角，在情節中前進並選擇與其他男性/女性角色浪漫。這是一個相對小眾的市場（根據一些消息來源為 ~$150M），但對行業產生了巨大的影響。例如，Fate/Grand Order 是最成功的扭蛋遊戲之一，累計收入為 $5B+，它源自一部名為 Fate/Stay Night 的視覺小說。

The structure of the visual novel with branching dialogue trees is a precursor to modern AI companions today. While there are many practical use cases for AI-simulated human interactions – AI as therapist, as teacher, as assistant, etc. – one of the most popular realizations are as friends and romantic companions (more on the broader companion space from my colleagues here). For instance, character.ai’s top characters are all from Genshin Impact; Raiden, Yae Miko, and Hu Tao take some of the top spots at 390M, 202M, and 113M messages respectively as of the time of this blog, compared to Elon Musk at a mere 40M messages. Other top characters are Gojo Satoru (638M) from popular shounen Jujutsu Kaisen and Levi Ackerman (250M) from Attack on Titan.

帶有分支對話樹的視覺小說的結構是當今現代 AI 伴侶的先驅。雖然 AI 類比的人類互動有許多實際用例——AI 作為治療師、老師、助手等——但最受歡迎的實現之一是作為朋友和浪漫伴侶（更多關於我的同事們的更廣泛的伴侶空間的資訊在這裡）。例如，character.ai 的頂級角色都來自 Genshin Impact;截至本博客發佈時，雷電、八重美子和胡濤分別以 390M、202M 和 113M 消息位居榜首，而埃隆馬斯克只有 40M 消息。其他頂級角色是來自流行的少年柔術回戰的五條悟 （638M） 和來自進擊的巨人 的 Levi Ackerman （250M）。

Many of the top companion sites like janitorai, chub.ai, or spicychat.ai also feature anime companions – ranging from roleplay with school bullies to overprotective sisters to… furries? – as some of their top personalities. There are also vertically specific companion apps for anime: crushon.ai is an 18+ example, talkieai is relatively safe-for-work, while Hyper includes VTuber-esque live facial elements. There’s moemate which allows you to bring the companions cross-browser and play games like chess and checkers, and kajiwoto that allows you to more deeply customize your prompts and datasets and share them on server.

許多頂級伴侶網站，如 janitorai、chub.ai 或 spicychat.ai 也提供動漫伴侶——從與學校惡霸的角色扮演到過度保護的姐妹，再到......毛茸茸的？——作為他們的一些頂級人物。還有一些垂直特定的動漫配套應用程式：crushon.ai 是一個 18+ 的例子，talkieai 對工作來說相對安全，而 Hyper 包括 VTuber 式的即時面部元素。有 moemate 允許您讓同伴跨瀏覽器玩國際象棋和跳棋等遊戲，而 kajiwoto 允許您更深入地自定義您的提示和數據集並在伺服器上共享它們。

AI is deepening the previously parasocial relationships we had with our favorite anime characters from passive linear media, into powerful new, interactive relationships. The reason why anime is so resonant as a genre for AI companions is because character affinity / romance is already built into many of the best anime stories. The majority of top anime games and visual novels are role playing games that feature a romance mechanic, and so it’s natural for fans to want to deepen their connection to their favorite IP and characters through active interactions.

AI 正在加深我們以前與我們最喜歡的動漫角色之間的超社會關係，從被動線性媒體，發展成強大的新互動關係。動漫作為 AI 伴侶的一種類型之所以如此引起共鳴，是因為角色親和力 / 浪漫已經內置到許多最好的動漫故事中。大多數頂級動漫遊戲和視覺小說都是具有浪漫機制的角色扮演遊戲，因此粉絲們希望通過積極的互動來加深與自己喜歡的 IP 和角色的聯繫是很自然的。

As AI advances, the interactions will become non-scripted and more multi-modal: we’ll interact with our companions through voice and text, their animations and reactions will be generated in real time, we’ll be able to play games with them, and they’ll have longer context windows to remember our shared history together. We’re already seeing startups pushing the boundaries for how we interact with content. Sekai is using AI to create short, bite-sized videos of you and anime characters in fanfiction-esque scenarios. Meanwhile, there are several stealth studios that are building otome games in the vein of Love and Deep Space ($200m+ annualized revenue, SensorTower), but where the side quests, dates, and interaction texts in the game are AI-generated.

隨著人工智慧的進步，交互將變得非腳本化，並且更加多模式：我們將通過語音和文本與我們的同伴互動，他們的動畫和反應將即時生成，我們將能夠與他們一起玩遊戲，他們將有更長的上下文視窗來記住我們共同的歷史。我們已經看到初創公司正在突破我們與內容交互方式的界限。Sekai 正在使用 AI 在同人小說式的場景中製作您和動漫角色的簡短視頻。與此同時，有幾家隱身工作室正在打造 Love 和 Deep Space 風格的乙女遊戲（年化收入 $200m+，SensorTower），但遊戲中的支線任務、日期和交互文本是 AI 生成的。

Anime is the new playground for content creation. Fans often engage with anime IP by creating their own versions of art, novels, and games, and innovation is happening across the stack. There’s Nijijourney for art, NovelAI for fanfiction, pixivFANBOX for creator support, and UGC-platforms for games. For instance, several of the top Roblox games are based on IP like One Piece or One Punch Man, and for a platform with over 60M DAU and 300M MAU, this is a very broad player base of anime fans. In particular, Roblox is a good proxy for what’s trending with the younger generation given its demographic skews towards kids and teens. Similar to how AI companions give fans a new way to interact with IP, UGC allows them to reimagine and remix their favorite IP in wholly new contexts.

Anime 是內容創作的新遊樂場。粉絲們經常通過創造自己的藝術、小說和遊戲版本來參與動漫 IP，並且創新正在整個堆疊中發生。有用於藝術的 Nijijourney、用於同人小說的 NovelAI、用於創作者支援的 pixivFANBOX 和用於遊戲的 UGC 平臺。例如，幾款頂級 Roblox 遊戲都是基於 IP 的，如《海賊王》或《一拳超人》，對於一個擁有超過 60M DAU 和 300M MAU 的平臺，這是一個非常廣泛的動漫迷玩家群。特別是，鑒於 Roblox 的人口結構偏向兒童和青少年，它很好地代表了年輕一代的趨勢。與 AI 伴侶為粉絲提供與 IP 互動的新方式類似，UGC 允許他們在全新的環境中重新構想和重新混合他們最喜歡的 IP。

Blox Fruits, the second most popular Roblox game by active users with 40B+ visits, is based off of One Piece, where players can choose to roleplay as a Marine or Pirate, fight enemies, improve their characters, and obtain special abilities through devil/blox fruits and Haki. The Strongest Battlegrounds, the fourth most popular Roblox game with 7B+ visits, is based on One Punch Man where you can assume the role of different heroes that have special abilities and combos to fight other players. And in Minecraft, many of the most popular servers that players frequent are based on Pokemon or Naruto.

Blox Fruits 是活躍使用者第二受歡迎的 Roblox 遊戲，訪問量為 40B+，它基於海賊王，玩家可以選擇扮演海軍陸戰隊員或海盜，與敵人戰鬥，提升他們的角色，並通過惡魔/blox 水果和 Haki 獲得特殊能力。The Strongest Battlegrounds 是第四大最受歡迎的 Roblox 遊戲，擁有 7B+ 的訪問量，它基於 One Punch Man，您可以在其中扮演具有特殊能力和連擊的不同英雄的角色來與其他玩家戰鬥。在 Minecraft 中，玩家經常光顧的許多最受歡迎的伺服器都是基於 Pokemon 或 Naruto 的。

![Image](https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/UGC-e1726868525538.png)

There are a few notable reasons for the popularity of these games. The first is that there’s clear player demand against a shortage of high quality anime IP games; one example is Palworld’s recent success as the “Pokemon with guns” game, selling over 25M copies in a month across Steam and Xbox Game Pass. The second reason is that the anime IP licensing landscape is notoriously difficult to navigate for developers, creating a potential undersupply of games. Besides the language and cultural barrier, IP may be owned by different parties for different regions and different formats (movie, game, manga, etc.). Large aggregators like Crunchyroll and Funimation may already own exclusive licenses for certain IPs altogether. Some startups like Kasagi Labo, Layer, and Story Protocol are tackling this issue to make IP more democratized and easier to access.

這些遊戲受歡迎的有幾個顯著原因。首先是玩家對高品質動漫 IP 遊戲的短缺有明顯的需求;一個例子是 Palworld 最近作為「帶槍的口袋妖怪」遊戲的成功，在 Steam 和 Xbox Game Pass 上一個月內售出超過 25M 份。第二個原因是，眾所周知，動漫 IP 許可環境對開發者來說很難駕馭，從而導致遊戲可能供不應求。除了語言和文化障礙外，智慧財產權可能由不同方針對不同地區和不同格式（電影、遊戲、漫畫等）擁有。像 Crunchyroll 和 Funimation 這樣的大型聚合器可能已經完全擁有某些 IP 的獨家許可。Kasagi Labo、Layer 和 Story Protocol 等一些初創公司正在解決這個問題，以使 IP 更加民主化和更容易訪問。

We believe that as new AI tools emerge and existing UGC platforms embrace AI, we’ll see the barriers to creation drop and the release of even more fan-created transmedia content. Roblox has already incorporated AI into user workflows, and Google’s DeepMind team recently announced Genie which can convert prompts into 2D playable environments. The Tencent team also recently unveiled GameGen-O which pushes the boundaries for generated open world games like Genshin Impact.

我們相信，隨著新的 AI 工具的出現和現有的 UGC 平台擁抱 AI，我們將看到創作障礙的減少和更多粉絲創作的跨媒體內容的發布。Roblox 已經將 AI 整合到使用者工作流程中，谷歌的 DeepMind 團隊最近發佈了可以將提示轉換為 2D 可玩環境的 Genie。騰訊團隊最近還推出了 GameGen-O，它突破了 Genshin Impact 等生成的開放世界遊戲的界限。

Beyond UGC platforms, AI models and tools are enabling first-time creators to make compelling anime content that previously would only have been possible with a team of professionals. For art, Nijijourney is an image diffusion model focused on generating high-quality anime images from text, a collaboration between Spellbrush and Midjourney. There are also various fine-tuned Stable Diffusion models (a few here hosted on citiv.ai) that capture different styles and poses, some trained on SD 1.5, others like Animagine XL V3 on SDXL 1.0. Yodayo integrates AI generated anime art and character chatbots together, and pixai.art contains models that mimic popular IP (Genshin, Pokemon, Blue Archive, etc.).

除了 UGC 平臺之外，AI 模型和工具還使首次創作者能夠製作引人入勝的動漫內容，而這在以前只有專業團隊才能完成。對於藝術，Nijijourney 是一種圖像傳播模型，專注於從文本生成高品質的動漫圖像，這是 Spellbrush 和 Midjourney 之間的合作。還有各種微調的 Stable Diffusion 模型（其中一些託管在 citiv.ai 上），可以捕捉不同的風格和姿勢，其中一些是在 SD 1.5 上訓練的，另一些是在 SDXL 1.0 上訓練的 Animagine XL V3。Yodayo 將 AI 生成的動漫藝術和角色聊天機器人集成在一起，pixai.art 包含模仿流行 IP（Genshin、Pokemon、Blue Archive 等）的模型。

For animations and video there are several options available for the aspiring creator. RunwayML, Luma Labs, Hedra, and PikaLabs have built foundation models for text-to-video generation. One can use domoAI for anime-specific polish, and MagnificAI and Topaz Labs to enhance images and image-to-video prompts. ElevenLabs is used for voiceovers and dubs, and Udio and Suno are used for music. For manga/comics, there are companies like Shortbread that are helping to create webcomics and manga more seamlessly, with context and consistency between scenes and shots. There’s still a way to go to improve model accuracy, speed, and cost, but it’s clear that as these tools evolve they will empower more creators that might previously have lacked technical or artistic skills to bring their anime ideas to life.

對於動畫和視頻，有抱負的創作者有多種選擇。RunwayML、Luma Labs、Hedra 和 PikaLabs 已經構建了文本到視頻生成的基礎模型。可以使用 domoAI 進行特定於動漫的潤色，並使用 MagnificAI 和 Topaz Labs 來增強圖像和圖像到視頻的提示。ElevenLabs 用於畫外音和配音，Udio 和 Suno 用於音樂。對於漫畫/漫畫，有像 Shortbread 這樣的公司正在説明更無縫地創建網路漫畫和漫畫，並在場景和鏡頭之間具有上下文和一致性。提高模型的準確性、速度和成本還有很長的路要走，但很明顯，隨著這些工具的發展，它們將使更多以前可能缺乏技術或藝術技能的創作者能夠將他們的動漫創意變為現實。

On the other side of the spectrum, professional game studios are leading the charge for high production-value consumer experiences that build on or create new IP. Anime games are some of the highest grossing in the games industry, accounting for 20% of spend on the mobile app store despite only having usage penetration of <3%. For example, Monster Strike has out-earned Candy Crush ($7.6B cumulative revenue vs. $6.9B) on a much smaller player base of 10M MAU vs. Candy Crush’s 70M+ MAU (SensorTower, 2016-19). Meanwhile, miHoYo’s Genshin Impact is on track to be one of the highest earning games of all time at its current trajectory (see below), with nearly $4B earned since launching just over three years ago.

![Image](https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Total-Lifetime-Net-Revenue-of-Top-Grossing-Anime-Mobile-Games-1.png)

There are two ways that anime game studios broaden the horizon for players. First, they usually create the highest quality games of the most popular IPs like Dragon Ball, Pokemon, or Dragon Quest. Six of the top 10 highest grossing anime games are based on existing IP, allowing fans to interact directly with the characters themselves. Second, they often innovate on core game loops or technology: miHoYo’s Genshin Impact was one of the first true cross-platform anime games, GungHo’s Puzzles & Dragons mixed match-3 and RPG mechanics for the first time, and Riot’s Valorant was one of the most accessible entries into tactical first person shooters. There are also  several stealth startups experimenting with weaving LLMs into visual novel gameplay.

So, what makes these games so compelling and why do they make so much money? We theorize that there are a few key components that contribute to their success:

For now, we’ve been covering mostly free-to-play (F2P) mobile games. However, there are several successful PC/console anime games as well: Doki Doki Literature Club, the Persona series, the Final Fantasy series, the Fire Emblem series, and Phoenix Wright, just to name a few. Many of these game franchises have been sold quite successfully through a premium business model. For instance, the Final Fantasy VII remake was one of the most anticipated in the series, and sold over 3.5M copies in the first 3 days. After three years, it’s now sold over 7 million copies total.

![Image](https://img.youtube.com/vi/o8WkNXMExSw/hqdefault.jpg)

There are several startups that have taken up the mantle in the West to build anime games for a global audience, and we’re excited to see what kinds of new experiences they create for players. Odyssey Interactive is building competitive multiplayer PvP games like Omega Strikers. Pahdo Labs is building a UGC platform starting with the anime game Starlight Re:Volver. Believer is building an open world drawing on inspiration from Genshin Impact. Studio Sai has made a hybrid dating action game, while Starmi and Gaudium are both creating collectible hero gacha action games. These are just a few of the studios that are focused on realizing anime worlds for players. We believe that these studios will continue to push the boundaries of gameplay and technology, and we’re excited to see these new experiences come to fruition.

We’ve seen how AI companions, UGC, and games allow players different ways of interacting with popular anime IP. VTubing takes it to the next level where fans can become popular anime characters themselves. VTuber stands for “Virtual YouTuber” and refers to a content creator who overlays an anime facial / body rig that tracks their real time motion and projects a digital avatar onto the stream (e.g. Kizuna AI). This phenomenon likely spawned from virtual idols such as Hatsune Miku that exist as fully digital characters, similar to virtual influencers like Lil Miquela in the west. There are various things that VTubers will do on stream, usually a mix of singing, chatting, dancing, and gaming. It allows for the creator to adopt a different personality, and makes it easier to create content regardless of appearance or age.

![Image](https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/09/Growth-of-VTubing-Hours-Watched-Over-Time.png)

Today, VTubing is a relatively small but fast-growing community that has potential to ride the anime wave into a much larger segment of content viewership and creation. While VTubers only represent 0.4% of all streamers on Twitch, they represent 5.7% of total viewership. And in the first half of 2023, VTubing viewership rose by 28% despite overall Twitch views staying flat. Some of the top VTubers like Ironmouse have millions of viewers, and are professionally run by organizations like VShojo or Hololive. One day, VTubing could become just as ubiquitous as Memojis on Apple FaceTime or Snapchat filters.

Startups are tackling this market from a few different angles. Iron Vertex is the go to for professional rigs done by designers experienced in Live2D, but if you need a cheaper option, startups like Hyperonline or GoHibe are making it easier than ever to design your own avatar. Mtion.tv meanwhile helps users design the background and environment for their avatar with visual based programming. There’s also VTubers like Neuro-sama, which is an AI that represents a human VTubing streamer, and platforms that are native to the VTuber experience like Anilive. If anime companions represent the human-digital relationship and multiplayer games the human-to-human relationship, then VTubing sits in the middle as a unique parasocial relationship mixing digital and human interactions.

Today, anime is more than an art style, it’s a content format and cultural aesthetic that has transcended gender, race, age, and geography to become one of the largest and most profitable creative industries. Anime is also leading the way for digital play, turning previously passive consumption of linear media into a new dynamic form of entertainment. We’re excited about how anime is shaping the future of interactivity through its embrace of new technologies and business models: from AI agents to UGC platforms, from artistry tools to novel game mechanics, from interactive VTubing to new anime platforms. It’s clear that the best is yet to come for current and future anime fans.
